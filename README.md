# Tiling

Biosyntagma has the ability to precisely segment a tissue sample into a 90 well grid to provide gene concentrations for any number of genes of interest, retaining information on relative concentrations throughout the sample. These grids can be considered as heat maps for each gene. Together, they may hold valuable information about gene patterns in normal tissue and tumor tissue that could be used for predicting whether a patient is likely to respond to a given treatment. This information could help to individualize pharmaceuticals. The Tiling project will investigate the benefit retaining the dimensionality of the gene data in a sample, compared with training a model on gene summary statistics. The gene patterns will be randomly simulated and used to train both a convolutional neural network and a comparison classifier (TBD, trained on summary data). The models will be evaluated on their ability to predict whether a sample is representative of normal gene concentrations, gene concentrations in a tumor patient likely to respond to a given treatment (responders) or gene concentrations in a tumor patient unlikely to respond to a given treatment (nonresponders).
